description "Object ID: 3305 - This IPSO object should be used over a power measurement sensor to report a remote power measurement.  It also provides resources for minimum/maximum measured values and the minimum/maximum range for both active and reactive power. Il also provides resources for cumulative energy, calibration, and the power factor."
