# Eclipse Leshan (LWM2M) Generator

This generator supports the OMA LWM2M specification by mapping an information model to LWM2M objects and resources.

The Generator outputs:

 - Eclipse Leshan Client that sends and receives LWM2M messages to and from the LWM2M server.

This generator **requires a Vorto Mapping** definition mapping from a function block element to a LWM2M model element.
