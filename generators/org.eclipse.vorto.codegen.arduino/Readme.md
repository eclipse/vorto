# Arduino Generator

The code generated by this plugin allows for simple telemetry use-cases for Arduino devices. The code provides a simple API to an information model for an embedded device and is independent on any underlying libraries.
The sample sketch is based on the [PubSubClient](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/) and works on any Arduino device supported by PubSubClient and out-of-the-box supports ESP8266 based devices.
