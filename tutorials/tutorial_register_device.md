## Steps

- Open the <a href="https://console.bosch-iot-suite.com">Bosch IoT Developer Console</a>
- Log in to the console with your evaluation tenant, username and password.

- Choose the protocol connector that the device connects to the Suite, e.g. **HTTP**. Confirm your selection with _Next_
- Give your device a unique name. For example
	- Namespace: com.mycompany
	- Technical ID: For example the mac address of the device, like _FCD6BD100B88_. Confirm your settings with _Complete_
- Now you have successfully registered your device with the Suite for a given Vorto information model and you should be able to see it in the thing browser:

- Send test data to registered thing and verify the incoming data in the Developer Console:

```
curl -X PUT 
https://things.apps.bosch-iot-cloud.com/api/1/things/ADD_THING_ID_HERE/features/temperature
-H 'authorization: Basic  ADD_CREDENTIALS_HERE' \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H 'x-cr-api-token: ADD_THINGS_API_TOKEN_HERE' \
-d '{"properties": {"sensor_value":22.2}}'
```
