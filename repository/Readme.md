# Vorto Repository

The Vorto Repository lets you

 * **Describe** device capabilities and functionality as Information Models using built-in Web Editors.
 * **Search** Information Models via different criteria
 * **Generate** Code for Information Models to integrate a device with IoT platforms
 * **Import** other (standardized) device descriptions, e.g. LwM2M/IPSO, in order to manage them in the Vorto Repository and use Vorto Code Generators
 * **Review** and **Release** Information Models in order to use these in IoT Business Solutions, e.g. for Device Data Validation.
