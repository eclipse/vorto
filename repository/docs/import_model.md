# Importing a Vorto Model 

If you had created an external / 3rd party tool to create Vorto Models, you can easily import it into the Repository.

## Prerequisite

* Github account
* Existing Vorto Model(s)

## Steps to Import any type of model

* Log in to Vorto Repository with your Github account
* Click **Import** of the menu bar
* Choose **Vorto** as type of models to import 
> Vorto allows to import other file types into the Repository, such as LwM2M/IPSO. 

* Click **Browse** and select the Vorto model(s)
> The file name extensions could be: _.mapping_, _.infomodel_, _.type_, _.fbmodel_

* Confirm with **Upload**. This uploads and validates the models before you can check them in.  
* If the validation was successful, you can select **Check in** to finalize the import.
