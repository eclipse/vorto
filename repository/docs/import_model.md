# Importing a Vorto Model 

If you had created an external / 3rd party tool to create Vorto Models, you can easily import it into the Repository.

## Prerequisite

* [BoschID](https://accounts.bosch-iot-suite.com/) Account or [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
* Existing Vorto Model(s)
* You are a collaborator/owner of a namespace

## Steps to Import any type of model

1. Log in to Vorto Repository with your Github or BoschID account

2. Click **Import** of the menu bar

3. Choose **Vorto** as type of models to import 

> Vorto allows to import other file types into the Repository, such as LwM2M/IPSO. 

4. Click **Browse** and select the Vorto model(s)

> The file name extensions could be: _.mapping_, _.infomodel_, _.type_, _.fbmodel_

5. Confirm with **Upload**. This uploads and validates the models before you can check them in.  

6. If the validation was successful, you can select **Check in** to finalize the import.
