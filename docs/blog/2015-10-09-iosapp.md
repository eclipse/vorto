Welcome to this blogpost that explains how to develop an App using Vorto.

This App is an iOS Game that displays different moves on a Flat Screen based on the player's movement. The player has to follow specific moves. Two TI Sensortags are tied, one on each wrist to detect whether a move is a hit or not. 

Vorto provides a specific Information Model for these [TI Sensortags](http://vorto.eclipse.org/repo/#/details/examples.informationmodels.sensors/TI_SensorTag_CC2650/1.0.0){:target="_blank"}. Based on this Information Model, the necessary Swift code is generated with an iOS Platform Generator.

The generated Code can then be integrated into the iOS App. The relevant projects are available in github and can be accessed from the following links:
