Vorto is an open source tool that allows for creating and managing technology agnostic, abstract device descriptions, so called information models. 
Information models describe the attributes and the capabilities of real world devices. These information models can be managed and shared within the Vorto repository. 
In addition Vorto provides a code generator extension point where code generators can be plugged in.
