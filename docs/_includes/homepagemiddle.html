          <p class="ex"> The Vorto IoT toolset allows to comfortably create abstract, technology agnostic descriptions of devices. These descriptions are machine readable and thus can be transformed into formats that are required for an integration into a specific platform. By providing such device descriptions a device vendor allows an easy integration of devices into platforms for which Vorto code generators exist. </p>

          <p class="ex">Solution developers that integrate devices into specific platforms often have to write a lot of code that could be generated using information about the corresponding device. The Vorto code generator infrastructure allows to do that which results in a significant reduction of development efforts. </p>
