# Getting Started
When working in an **IoT environment** we have to ensure connected devices can **seamlessly communicate with cloud platforms**, regardless of the different manufacturer, technologies, and systems.

**In the past**, developers have built IoT solutions that were **specifically designed for a limited set of devices** that had the same API. When changing the device type or switching device manufacturers the device integration required time-consuming refactoring to work with the new device.

So the question is, how can we find out **which devices have the type of functionality we want** and how **can we avoid tight coupling** between a specific device so it is easier to switch to a similar device without too much refactoring?

## Concepts
Vorto provides an abstraction layer called the **Vorto Information Model**, and a **domain specific language** (DSL) which describes all the meta-information, like properties and functions, of a connected device.
By adding a layer of abstraction, we create a consistent interface that allows us to use different types of devices with similar functionality.

The Vorto project is built on **four main components**:

- **Vorto DSL**:
The Vorto DSL is a readable and easily understood domain-specific language that was specifically designed to be usable even by non-developers. It is used to create the abstract models of different devices.

- **Metamodel**:
The metamodel is used to define the relationship between the different entities like Information Models, Function Blocks, and Datatypes.

- **Code Generators**:
Based on the DSL and metamodels, the code generators provide a sophisticated but simple way to create source code for a convenient integration of the defined IoT devices with an IoT solution platform.

- **Vorto Repository**:
The repository is used to store, manage, and distribute the created Information Models and Function Blocks for re-use.

For a more in depth introduction into the concepts, feel free to **[read the blog post about Eclipse Vorto](https://blog.bosch-si.com/developer/eclipse-vorto-the-next-step-in-iot-device-integration/).**

## Learning Path


1. **Understand the Vorto DSL** using the [Vorto DSL Grammar Reference](../core-bundles/docs/quickhelp_dsl.md)

2. [**Create your Repository and manage namespaces**](tutorials/create_repository.md) to get ready for describing devices.

3. [**Describe your first device**](tutorials/describe_device-in-5min.md) in 5 minutes using the Vorto Web Editor - [(5min video)](.)
> You can also describe new devices using the [Vorto Eclipse IDE](tutorials/describe_device_with_eclipse_ide.md)

4. **Provision your device** to [create a new digital twin](tutorials/create_thing.md) inside Bosch IoT Things - [(9min video)](.)

5. **Integrate your device** using [Python](tutorials/mqtt-python.md) / [Java](tutorials/connect_javadevice.md) / [Arduino](tutorials/connect_esp8266.md) - [(8min video)](.)

6. **Visualize your sensor data** using the [Vorto Dashboard](tutorials/create_webapp_dashboard.md) - [(4min video)](.)
> You can also use the [Bosch IoT Things SwaggerUI](https://apidocs.bosch-iot-suite.com/?urls.primaryName=Bosch%20IoT%20Things%20-%20API%20v2#/Things) to validate your data if you're using the Bosch IoT Suite.
