# Getting Started 

This section provides you many tutorials to get you started with Vorto. 

## Vorto DSL

- [Describe a device in 5 minutes](tutorials/describe_device-in-5min.md)
- [Describe a TI SensorTag](tutorials/describe_tisensor.md)
- [Vorto DSL Grammar Reference](../core-bundles/docs/quickhelp_dsl.md)
- [Use Vorto Eclipse IDE](tutorials/describe_device_with_eclipse_ide.md) to describe a device
	
	
## Device Integration

With the following tutorials, you are going to learn to connect devices that are described with Vorto to the Bosch IoT Suite: 

- [Connect a Java - based device](tutorials/connect_javadevice.md)
- [Connect an ESP8266 - based device](tutorials/connect_esp8266.md)
- [Integrate a RaspberryPi with Python](tutorials/mqtt-python.md)
- Map arbitrary device payload to Vorto compliant data structures
  * [Mapping Engine for Java](../mapping-engine/Readme.md)
  * [Mapping Engine for Node.js](../mapping-engine-nodejs/README.md)
  * [Example: Mapping Security Camera binary data](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto-examples/blob/master/vorto-connector/Readme.md)


## Prototyping 

Tutorials that show you what you can do with Vorto Information Models to prototype an IoT Solution based on an IoT Platform:

- [Generate a Node.js Dashboard](tutorials/create_webapp_dashboard.md) that reads device data from Bosch IoT Suite and visualizes it in pre-defined Vorto UI Widgets.


## Misc

- [Reference Vorto Models files from your custom DSL](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto-examples/blob/master/vorto-dsl-integration/Readme.md) with [Eclipse Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/xtext)
