Two interesting talks around the Vorto project are going to be held at the Eclipse Conference North America from the **9th until the 12th of March 2015**. The first talk is about the Vorto project itself and the idea behind it. The second talk covers practical insights about the Eclipse Smarthome Platform - among others, how Vorto information models can be used to integrate new devices into the Smart Home platform.
