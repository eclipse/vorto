# Publishing Models

> **What does publishing mean** ?    
Publishing a model makes it visible to everybody visiting the Eclipse Vorto Repository. 
Even if they are not logged in and are not collaborating to the namespace.
Published models can only be `deprecated` and not deleted. 

<br />

## Making your model public
In order to have the permission to publish models, you need to fullfil a few requirements.   
You need to:
1. be an owner or collaborator to an [official namespace](#claiming-an-official-namespace).
1. have the role of `Publish` for the given offical namespace. 

Only after fullfillign those requirements you will be able to see the `Publish` button for the models of the according namespace.
