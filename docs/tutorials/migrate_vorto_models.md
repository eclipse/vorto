----------
This guide will walk you through the process of migrating your existing Vorto models from the old repository into the new Vorto repository. Let's get started.

## Prerequisites

## Steps
1. Log in to old [Vorto Repository](https://vorto-old.eclipse.org)
2. Select the model you would like to migrate(HINT: select the checkbox *Only My Models* to view models created by you)
3. Download your model (look for the attribute - Model File)

4. Log in to new [Vorto Repository](https://vorto.eclipse.org)
5. [Setup your Repository and Namespace](./create_repository.md), by default all new namespaces will be prefixed with *vorto.private*, to request for a custom namespace click on *Request Official Namespace*.
