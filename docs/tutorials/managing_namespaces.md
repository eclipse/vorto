# Managing Namespaces

> **What is a Namespace** ?    
A namespace provides a secure workspace for saving models, without interfering with models of other users.



<br />

## Creating your Namespace
When you first login with your account, you won't be able to create Vorto Models.   
In order to create them, you need to either own your own namespace or be part of a project in which you've been assigned the role of *Model Creator*.

Creating a new namespace can easily be done by clicking on the `Manage` tab and then `Create`.

<br />

This will trigger a dialog box which let's you enter the namespace you want to use.   
> **Note**: Each newly created Namespace will use the `vorto.private` prefix. If you want to claim an official namespace like e.g. `org.eclipse.vorto` you need to [reach out to the Vorto Team](mailto:vorto-development@bosch-si.com?Subject=Request%20Vorto%20Repository%20Namespace&body=Dear%20Vorto%20Team%2C%20%0A%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20request%20for%20an%20official%20namespace.%20%0A%0ANamespace%20Owner%20%28user%20ID%29%20%3A%20%0ANamespace%3A%0A%0AThank%20you.%20%0A%0ABest%20regards%2C%20).

<br />

Once the create button is clicked, your new namespace will be created.   
By default, you as the namespace owner will have all permissions and are able to manage the namespace and it's collaborators.

## Claiming an official Namespace
If you want to make the models you've created publicly available, you need to own the according official namespace.   
In order to claim an official namespace, like e.g. `org.eclipse.vorto`, you need to [reach out to the Vorto Team](mailto:vorto-development@bosch-si.com?Subject=Request%20Vorto%20Repository%20Namespace&body=Dear%20Vorto%20Team%2C%20%0A%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20request%20for%20an%20official%20namespace.%20%0A%0ANamespace%20Owner%20%28user%20ID%29%20%3A%20%0ANamespace%3A%0A%0AThank%20you.%20%0A%0ABest%20regards%2C%20).

When reaching out to the Vorto Dev Team, please make sure to **include the name of the namespace and UserId of its Owner**.
