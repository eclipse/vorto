# Create a full payload mapping pipeline

This tutorial explains how to create a full pipeline for payload mapping with a real device sending device payload.

In this example we'll be using a pre-created model you can find in the [Vorto Repository](.). Of course, you can also use your own device.    
Throughout this tutorial, we will set up a pipeline of mapping device payload that is then sent to AWS AMQ in order to allow easy subscription of applications.

### Prerequisite
* [BoschID](https://accounts.bosch-iot-suite.com/) Account or [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
* You are a collaborator/owner of a namespace
* Subscription to [Asset Communication for Bosch IoT Suite](https://www.bosch-iot-suite.com/asset-communication/) (Free plan, no credit card required)
* AWS Account for [AMQ Service](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/)

<br />

## Steps

**1**. Register your device and create a new Thing from the Information Model.
**2**. Send data from the device to [IoT Hub](https://www.bosch-iot-suite.com/service/hub/).
**2**. Receive data from Hub with the Data Normalizer
**3**. Create a Mapping Specification for your device.
**4**. Set up AWS AMQ to provide your device data
**5**. Connect Things to your AMQ Instance
**6**. Visualize your device data with the [Vorto Dashboard](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto-examples/tree/master/vorto-dashboard)

## Register your device and create a new Thing from the Information Model.
Test

Combines registring a new device with Hub, creating a policy, and creating a new, empty, Thing with credentials.
