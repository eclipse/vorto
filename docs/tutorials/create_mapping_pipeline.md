# Create a full payload mapping pipeline

This tutorial explains how to create a full pipeline for payload mapping with a real device sending device payload.

In this example we'll be using a pre-created model you can find in the [Vorto Repository](.). Of course, you can also use your own device.    
Throughout this tutorial, we will set up a pipeline of mapping device payload that is then sent to AWS AMQ in order to allow easy subscription of applications.
