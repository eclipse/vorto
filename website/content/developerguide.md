## Repository API

Search and access Vorto models as well as invoke Vorto Code Generators with the [Repository Java Client](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/tree/development/repository/repository-java-client/Readme.md)

## Repository Import API

If you want to manage other existing (standardized) device descriptions with the Vorto Repository, you can implement a custom importer using the [Importer API](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/development/repository/repository-importer/Readme.md).

## Device Payload Mapping API

Map arbitrary device payload, expressed as JSON or binary, to standardized data, that is described by Vorto Information Models. See [Payload Mapping Documentation]({{< ref "tutorials/payloadmapping.md" >}}) for more information.
