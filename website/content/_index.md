> **TL;DR** Vorto provides a Vorto Repository managing IoT device descriptions and providing code generators to integrate devices easily with various IoT platforms, e.g. Bosch IoT Suite, AWS IoT, ThingWorx and more.

The indented use of the Vorto project is that a IoT Device is described using  Vorto DSL. 
By providing a unified way to describe an IoT Device, a variety of services can be employed that draw on the information contained in the description. One use case is th code generation for the integration with Bosch IoT Suite and other IoT platforms. Check out [our tutorials]({{< relref "tutorials/arduino.md" >}}) to find out more.

The [Vorto Repository](http://vorto.eclipse.org) is a central repository where you can manage and organize IoT Device Information Models. If you want to set up your own repository in your infrastructure, take a look at our [setup guide](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/tree/development/repository/repository-web)
