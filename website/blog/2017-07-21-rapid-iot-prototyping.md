Eclipse Vorto is a great infrastructure to help you getting started with IoT development, particularly with the Bosch IoT Suite. But that's not it. Vorto supports many other platforms, such as AWS or Google. The following webinar video (Source: [Eclipse Virtual IoT Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Virtual-IoT/events/240383713/)) is going to give you some insights about the idea behind Vorto and how to use the Vorto's infrastructure to develop an IoT application in no time, based on the Eclipse IoT Software Stack and Bosch IoT Suite. Have fun :)
