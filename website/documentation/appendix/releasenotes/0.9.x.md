## Release Notes - 0.9.x

We are proud to announce the release of 0.9. 
Here are some of the major highlights:

- **Eclipse IoT Toolset** that lets you describe the characteristics and functionalities of devices as Information Models
- **Information Model Repository**, acting as a device description dictionary to lookup and find device cababilities by various criteria
- **Generator API** that lets you define the translation rules from Information Models into executable, IoT platform specific source code
- Many **Code Generators** to inspire you to build your own generator as well as illustrate the usage to build an IoT Application.
- **Command Line Interface** that lets you lookup, find and publish information models as well as generate code for a selected IoT platform

### Eclipse IoT Toolset

With the **Eclipse IoT Toolset**, you can describe the characteristics and functionality of devices as Information Models, publish them to the Information Model Repository and generate code with the help of Code Generators.

### Information Model Repository

The **Information Model Repository** manages your device descriptions in a central place and exposes its functionality as a clean REST-API. Users are able to lookup and search device cababilities, checkin new models as well as translate Information Models into a selected IoT Platform source code.

### Generator API

Vorto Code Generators convert an Information Model into executable IoT platform specific source code. The **Generator API** lets you plug in your own code generator into the toolset. Toolset wizards help you through this process.
  
### Code Generators

In order to inspire you to build you own generator for your platform, we implemented many **Code Generators**, for example Bosch IoT Things, AWS, ThingWorx and many more. They illustrate the many possibilities of how code generators can be effectively used and act as a blueprint for other generator implementations.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

A **Command Line Interface Tool** lets you explore information models, checkin new information models as well as generate code for a selected IoT platform.
