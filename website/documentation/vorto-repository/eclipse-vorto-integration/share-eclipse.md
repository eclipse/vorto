You can share models (information models, function block models or data type models) by uploading them to the Model Repository out of the Eclipse Vorto Toolset.

For sharing models using the Web Interface, refer to [Sharing Models Using the Web Interface](../web-interface/share-web.html).  
For sharing models using the Vorto CLI tool, refer to [Vorto CLI Tool]({{base}}/documentation/cli-tool/cli-tool.html).

* You have started Eclipse.
* You have selected the Vorto perspective.

**Proceed as follows**

1. In the model explorer, right-click the model you want to share and select **Share**.
